NYC Collision Analysis: Identifying Primary Causes of Accidents

Project Overview
This project investigates the primary causes of motor vehicle collisions in New York City using public NYPD data. By analyzing contributing factors, this study aims to highlight the human behaviors that lead to the highest frequency of accidents, providing a data-driven perspective on road safety.

The Problem
New York City experiences a high volume of traffic incidents daily. Understanding whether these are caused by environmental conditions, mechanical failures, or driver behavior is essential for city planning and public awareness.

Data & Methodology
Source: NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes (via NYC Open Data SODA API).

Tools: Python, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

Process: I cleaned a dataset of 10,000 recent records, filtered out unspecified entries, and calculated the frequency of specific contributing factors.

Key Insights
Human Error Dominates: The analysis reveals that the vast majority of collisions are caused by human behavior rather than external factors like vehicle failure or poor road conditions.

The Top Offender: "Driver Inattention/Distraction" is the leading cause of accidents, occurring significantly more often than any other factor.

Secondary Causes: Following distraction, "Failure to Yield Right-of-Way" and "Following Too Closely" round out the top three contributors.

Conclusion
The data clearly shows that the most effective way to reduce collisions in NYC is to address driver focus and behavior. This project underscores that most "accidents" are actually preventable through improved driver attention and stricter adherence to traffic laws.
